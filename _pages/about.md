## 👋🏻 About Me
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student and Research Assistant at the National University of Singapore under the guidance of Professor [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Business Analytics from the National University of Singapore. My research sits at the intersection of **cryptocurrency**, **graph analytics**, and **data mining**, with applications to  **cryptocurrency economics**, and **fraud/risk analysis**.
